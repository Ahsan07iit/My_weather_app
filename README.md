Hi Everyone!
I created a new web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).
My weather app shows the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value in Celsius unit, the weather description, and then the user's city and country.

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
